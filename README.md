# DISCLAIMER
This is a fork of the Magento-vsbridge-indexer I customised to work with ElasticSearch 6.5 on cloudways. I did this because cloudways do not allow updating the version of elasticsearch on their hosting platform.

The updated remote branch is located in the 2.x branch.
The code I use is in the es6.5 branch
